* This MQSC configuration is used for all queue managers in the demo uniform cluster
* Nothing in this configuration is specific to a particular queue manager

* Simplify the demo system by disabling channel and connection authentication
ALTER QMGR CHLAUTH(DISABLED) CONNAUTH(' ')
REFRESH SECURITY TYPE(CONNAUTH)

* The only definition required to join a Uniform CLuster when using AutoCluster is to define a cluster receiver channel
* This will use the cluster name from the AutoCluster ini file setting and the connection name from the crtmqm command
DEFINE CHANNEL(UNICLUSTER.+QMNAME+) CHLTYPE(CLUSRCVR) CLUSTER(+AUTOCL+) CONNAME(+CONNAME+) SHORTRTY(120) SHORTTMR(5)

* Every queue manager needs to accept client connections
DEFINE CHANNEL(SVRCONN.CHANNEL) CHLTYPE(SVRCONN)

************************************
* Application Object Definitions   *
************************************
* We define the same topic, queue, and subscription on every queue manager in the uniform cluster.
* Note that because these definitions are not themselves 'clustered', all publish/subscribe
* activity is constrained to the local queue manager.  In this example, this ensures that only
* one subscribing (getter) application receives each publication.

* Define the Topic object on every queue manager in the cluster
* (this could be ommitted if all publishers and subscribers worked directly with 
* the Topic string and no additional properties are required for the Topic.)
DEFINE TOPIC(TESTTOP) TOPICSTR('demo/testtopic')

* Define the target queue for subscriptions
DEFINE QLOCAL(DESTQ1) DEFPSIST(YES)

* Define the administrative subscription for our sample receiving application
DEFINE SUB(TESTSUB) TOPICOBJ(TESTTOP) DEST(DESTQ1)
