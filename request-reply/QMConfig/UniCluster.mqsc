* This MQSC configuration is used for all queue managers in the demo uniform cluster
* Nothing in this configuration is specific to a particular queue manager

* Simplify the demo system by disabling channel and connection authentication
ALTER QMGR CHLAUTH(DISABLED) CONNAUTH(' ')
REFRESH SECURITY TYPE(CONNAUTH)

* The only definition required to join a Uniform CLuster when using AutoCluster is to define a cluster receiver channel
* This will use the cluster name from the AutoCluster ini file setting and the connection name from the crtmqm command
DEFINE CHANNEL(UNICLUSTER.+QMNAME+) CHLTYPE(CLUSRCVR) CLUSTER(+AUTOCL+) CONNAME(+CONNAME+) SHORTRTY(120) SHORTTMR(5)

* Every queue manager needs to accept client connections
DEFINE CHANNEL(SVRCONN.CHANNEL) CHLTYPE(SVRCONN)

* Messaging resources like queues need to be defined on every member of the uniform cluster.
* Note that this is ALSO a clustered queue - so both the messages themselves and the client
* applications are being balanced to spread workload.  This is not a requirement though,
* applications could work with local queues only.
